I'm a full stack software engineer who enjoys building web applications and playing with different 
frameworks and technologies. I've worked on creating user interfaces to shows hierarchical structures, geo spatial 
structures, server side components and integrating them with RESTful web-services. I like to explore and embrace new 
technologies like GraphQL, ES6, ReactJS and Serverless.
I've challenged myself with problems of scaling web applications and minimizing the operational cost.
