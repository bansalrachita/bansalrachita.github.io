I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys building web applications and playing with different 
frameworks and technologies. I've worked on creating user interfaces displaying hierarchical visualizations, geo 
spatial structures, components that display large datasets in an effiecient manner and integrating them 
with RESTful web-services. I like to adopt new technologies like GraphQL, ES6, ReactJS & Serverless, and challenge 
myself with problems of scaling web applications and minimizing the operational cost.
